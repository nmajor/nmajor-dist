<h1 id="hello">Hello!</h1>

<p>I am a full stack web developer. Throughout my career I’ve build and worked on projects in Ruby, Node, Python, and even Perl, using frameworks such as Rails, Sinatra, Express, Django, React and React Native, and these days I deploy my projects inside Docker contianers or serverless with AWS Lambda.</p>

<p>I hope I am using enough buzz words.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my page. Below are some personal projects that I am proud of.</p>

It also provides hilarious alternatives for what you could be doing with your time, like reading The Hobbit or running across the United States a certain number of times.</p>

<h3 id="missionary-memoir">Missionary Memoir</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.missionarymemoir.com/">visit</a></p>

<p>Missionary Memoir has a React frontend and a Node/Express.js backend.</p>

<p>Missionary Memoir is my biggest personal project. Its a business I started to help people print a custom hardcover book from their emails. Its mainly marketed towards missionaries who have sentimental emails from their missionary experiences that they want to keep forever in the form of a hardcover book.</p>

<p>I hope this works</p>
